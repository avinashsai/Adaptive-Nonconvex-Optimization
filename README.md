# Adaptive Methods for Nonconvex Optimization.
Implementation of YOGI optimizer as mentioned in the paper https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8186-adaptive-methods-for-nonconvex-optimization.

# Getting Started
 
Yogi is an optimizer proposed to overcome the disadvantages of Adam Optimizer. 

# Implementation

This is the first implementaion of Yogi Optimizer in PyTorch. 

# How to Run

Refer to PyTorch folder **README** for running the code.

# To-Do

1. Implement Yogi in

   a) MxNet

   b) Tensorflow

2. Add more experiments such as:

   a) Auto Encoders
   
   b) Machine Translation
